# School and Student Performance Metrics and Insights
# Description
This UT Module 4 pandas-challenge is an analysis using data about schools in certain districts and the impacts of resources, size and type to better understand how students might perform based on that information.

# Analysis

The first part of the analysis is understanding of the district in review.

The second part is a deeper looker at each school within the district. Below is a screenshot of the School Summary.

Next, we wanted to understand what schools were the highest performing and lowest performing, and what were the characteristics of those schools. Below is an image of top 5 highest performing schools and the bottom 5 lowest performing schools. The key characteristic that stands out is type.
